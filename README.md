# FASTQ Example

This is a stripped down version of the 
main [OSPool FastQC tutorial](https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/software_examples/bioinformatics/tutorial-fastqc/); 
it uses the [OSDF](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf.html) to deliver the container 
and data files. 

To use, clone the repository and open the
[FastQC_Tutorial.ipynb](FastQC_Tutorial.ipynb) notebook and execute the cells.
